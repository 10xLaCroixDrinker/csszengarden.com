Here it is, the first of what will hopefully be	many more modern designs in the CSS Zen Garden.	With this design, I've attempted to hit as many of today's front end	buzzwords as possible. It's a mobile-first, responsive layout that was	designed in the browser from start to finish. CSS3 is used liberally	with fallbacks where necessary.	All photos are mine, and were taken in the Japanese Garden at the	Huntington Botanical Garden in Southern California.	Other production notes:	* Vector assets are used where appropriate. The logo is an SVG file,	  the icons are a custom web font built with icomoon.io	* The column effect is a CSS gradient instead of a background image.	  By forcing a sharp transition at 66%, we can simulate columns. The way	  Webkit browsers round gradient values causes the columns to jump	  unexpectedly when the window is resized, which means that using an equal	  padding or width value doesn't align the way you think it would. That	  forced a bit of extra contortion to get the header and body columns	  perfectly lined up.	* Various sidebar H3s were hidden with display:none; This was a design	  decision. Their inclusion seemed extraneous.	* The sidebar positioning style is (necessarily) quite a mess on wider      windows, especially the resource list. When flexbox is a bit closer to      usable, maybe I'll take another crack at fixing that up.	* A more logical place for the design list to appear in the mobile	  version would have been up closer to the top, possibly disclosed with a      menu toggle of some kind. Not something that's easily doable with CSS      alone, if you don't want to rely on hovers.	* The medium- and low-res versions don't differ that much; I may still push	  the tablet layout a bit further, it doesn't quite feel right.	* Parallax scrolling isn't doable without Javascript so you won't find it	  in this design. I was able to use a bit of multiple background-position	  trickery to create a slightly more interesting scrolling effect.*/@import url(http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Julius+Sans+One|Libre+Baskerville:400,400italic);@import url(./214-base.css);@import url(./214-low.css);@import url(./214-mid.css);@import url(./214-high.css);/* icon fonts */@font-face {	font-family: 'verdemoderna';	src:url('verdemoderna.eot');	src:url('verdemoderna.eot?#iefix') format('embedded-opentype'),		url('verdemoderna.woff') format('woff'),		url('verdemoderna.ttf') format('truetype'),		url('verdemoderna.svg#verdemoderna') format('svg');	font-weight: normal;	font-style: normal;}
